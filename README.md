# 👋 Hi, I'm Isaac

🚀 AI Solutions Builder | Automation Specialist | Business-First Thinker

I design and implement smart AI and automation systems that solve real-world problems.  
My experience covers:

- 🤖 AI Agent Implementation (LangChain, OpenAI, Pinecone)
- 🔗 Automation Flows (n8n, API Integrations, Workflow Orchestration)
- 📊 Business Optimization (Booking Automation, Dispatch Efficiency, Customer Support AI)

🔎 I love building AI solutions that are measurable, scalable, and user-centric.

Currently focused on:  
→ AI-enhanced travel & logistics automation  
→ Building proactive customer experiences through smart agents

🏛️ Project Delivery Philosophy:

For major client projects, I set up dedicated GitHub repositories to manage AI workflows, automation assets, and agent architectures.  
This ensured transparency, future scalability, and easy knowledge transfer — empowering clients to maintain and grow their AI systems independently.
