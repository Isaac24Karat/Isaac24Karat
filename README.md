# 👋 Hi, I'm Isaac

🚀 **AI Systems Architect | Automation Specialist | Business-First Thinker**

I design and implement **smart AI and automation systems** that solve real-world operational challenges — connecting data, people, and processes to scale business impact.

My work bridges **AI, business systems, and data integrity**, helping organizations grow faster and operate with clarity.

### 🔧 Specializing In
• **AI + Low-Code Automation** (n8n, Flowise, Make)  
• **CRM & RevOps Data Pipelines** (HubSpot, Airtable)  
• **AI Governance + Validation** (JSON Schema, RAG frameworks)  
• **KPI-Driven Workflow Architecture** (forecasting, attribution, data hygiene)

---

### 💡 Currently Focused On
→ Building **GTM automation systems** for data-driven companies  
→ Designing **operational AI architecture** with human-in-the-loop principles  
→ Creating **self-healing data pipelines** and transparency dashboards

### 🏛️ Project Delivery Philosophy

For major client projects, I set up **dedicated GitHub repositories** to manage AI workflows, automation assets, and agent architectures.  
This ensures transparency, scalability, and easy knowledge transfer — empowering clients to maintain and grow their systems independently.

> 🎯 *Every automation I build is tied to measurable business KPIs — faster throughput, cleaner data, and lower manual effort.*

**Let's connect!** 🚀

### 🛡️ Note on Private Projects

Many of my real-world AI deployments are client-specific and under NDA, so most heavy activity is managed in private repositories.  
Each project follows the same **architecture principles, KPI-driven implementation**, and **business-first AI strategy** you’ll see in my public repos.

> The public projects here reflect the same engineering discipline and delivery philosophy I apply in real client environments.
