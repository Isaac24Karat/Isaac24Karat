# 👋 Hi, I'm Isaac

🚀 AI Systems Architect | Automation Specialist | Business-First Thinker
I design and implement smart AI and automation systems that solve real-world operational challenges.

My work focuses on bridging AI, business systems, and data integrity — helping organizations scale faster and operate with clarity.

🔧 Specializing in:
• AI + Low-Code Automation (n8n, Flowise, Make)
• CRM & RevOps Data Pipelines (HubSpot, Airtable)
• AI Governance + Validation (JSON Schema, RAG frameworks)

💡 Currently focused on:
→ GTM systems automation for data-driven companies
→ Operational AI architecture and human-in-the-loop design

🏛️ Project Delivery Philosophy:

For major client projects, I set up dedicated GitHub repositories to manage AI workflows, automation assets, and agent architectures.  
This ensured transparency, future scalability, and easy knowledge transfer — empowering clients to maintain and grow their AI systems independently.

🛡️ Note on Private Projects:

Since many of my real-world AI deployments were client-specific and under NDA, most of the heavy project activity is managed in private repositories.  
For each major client, I set up dedicated GitHub repositories to manage AI workflows, automation assets, and agent architectures — ensuring transparency, scalability, and easy future maintenance.

The public projects shared here reflect the same architecture principles, KPI-driven implementations, and business-first AI strategies that I used for real deployments.
